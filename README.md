## salesƒorce Machine Learning: Data Foundation
`DI` was contracted by salesƒorce to develop a custom Machine Learning curriculum for its software engineers. The organization’s goal is to get all developers thinking about data and how it can be used in the business. `DI` worked with Brian Sletten [bsletten](https://github.com/bsletten) to develop the course, which is delivered in two sections: <a href="https://github.com/developintelligenceboulder/sf-ml-data-foundation" target="_blank">Machine Learning: Data Foundation</a> (2 days) and <a href="https://github.com/bsletten/sf-ml-applied" target="_blank">Machine Learning: Algorithms and Applications</a> (3 days). 

The first course, <a href="https://github.com/developintelligenceboulder/sf-ml-data-foundation" target="_blank">__Machine Learning: Data Foundation__</a>, is intended to introduce Data Science and statistics concepts in order to form a foundation for the <a href="https://github.com/bsletten/sf-ml-applied" target="_blank">Machine Learning: Algorithms and Applications course</a>. Before you can apply Machine Learning concepts, you have to understand the science and statistics behind it. This course presents students with the overall concept of Machine Learning and its benefits to today’s business.

__Note [04.13.2018]__: Course name changed to Machine Learning: Data Foundation from Introduction to Machine Learning.

# Tips & Comments for Preparation and Delivery
`DI` wants you to succeed at teaching the Machine Learning: Data Foundation course! The Tips/Comments document is to be used for instructors to share comments and suggestions for conducting a great class. Please add to [this document](Tips-Comments.md) as you teach, and please check it frequently, as instructors will be continually adding comments!

## Evaluation Comments
You will find the Student evaluations compiled [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OixoJLO57-AwNkZOSKGSL5aI2-Ft5tgyE800euE8P-E/edit#gid=429542957). New evaluations will be added to the bottom of the sheet.  

# Student Questions
This document is intended to capture student questions asked during each class. They are to be used as reference for instructors in order to prepare for questions. If you receive a question in class that you believe would benefit the other instructors, please document it [here](StudentQuestions.md). This will be a living document, so please check back before each class!

# In Class

### class.html
On the first day of class, start with <a href="class.html" target="_blank">`class.html`</a>.  
`class.html` includes the introductory slides and links to the presentations for <a href="day1.html" target="_blank">Day 1</a> and <a href="day2.html" target="_blank">Day 2</a>.
If you have any extra time on day 1, please get a head start on day 2 as there is _a lot_ of content to cover on the second day of the course.
The links below will take you directly to a slide if you download this repo and open `README.html` in your browser. 
The presentation was made using [remark.js](http://remarkjs.com)

### day1.html includes:

### Using Presentation Mode and Notes
To view the slides in a normal manner, just open the appropriate `html` file.

- `c` clones the existing window but keeps the slide displayed in each window synchronized
- `p` will enter Presentation mode (showing notes)

Suggested way to do presentations:

1. Separate your displays so laptop and projector are different displays.
2. Hit `c` to get two slide windows
3. Put one of each window in each display
4. Hit `p` on the window on your laptop screen to view notes, etc.

### Suggested Timings

These timings are for the purpose of making sure the second half of Day 2 is dedicated to algorythims (The Machine Learning Approaches section and later). 

|     Day     |     Time     |     Last Finished Section       |              Next Section
| :---------: | :----------: | :-----------------------------: | :---------------------------------------:
   Day 1      |     Lunch    |  Exercise: Summary Stats of TTL | Understanding Relationships Between Variables
   Day 1      |     End      |  Probablity                     | Hypothesis Testing - Z-Score
   Day 2      |     Lunch    |  Data Science (to Newton)       | Machine Learning Approaches

__Notes__  
[March 15, 2018] Notes are currently most helpful as preparation materials. Adjusting the notes to be more useful during presentation is currently underway.
